#### The above picture shows the progress I made when I first started this project in March 2019. It wasn't a lot that's for sure. I remember I got frustrated  because I couldn't align the elements like the way I wanted to. "Why is nothing working," I muttered to myself as I blindly typed random CSS selectors and declarations hoping for something to work. Unable to find a solution, I gave up and haven't touched the project since March 2020, essentially a whole year later.

#### Now, I've become a lot more comfortable with flexbox, responsive design, and CSS in general. Ultimately, I realized that it just takes time, persistence, and practice to get good at web development, and I have to keep reminding myself that as I continue to self-educate.

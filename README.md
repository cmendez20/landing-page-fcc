The above picture shows the progress I made when I first started this project in March 2019. It wasn't a lot, that's for sure. I remember I got frustrated because I couldn't align the elements like the way I wanted to. "Why is nothing working," I muttered to myself as I blindly typed random CSS selectors and declarations hoping for something to work. Unable to find a solution, I gave up and haven't touched the project since. Almost a whole year later, I started up the project again in late March and completed it April 27th, 2020 at 12:20 AM.

Now, I've become a lot more comfortable with flexbox, responsive design, and CSS in general. Ultimately, I realized that it just takes time, persistence, and practice to get good at web development, and I have to keep reminding myself that as I continue to self-educate and journey forth in my attempt at becoming employed as a frontend web developer.
